# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Much of the [prelude of Babel's Contributing guide](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) also applies here since babel-minify is just a set of babel plugins, a preset and tools built on top of these things with babel itself.
